Q3) Explain what does django-admin.py make messages command is used for?

Ans) The make_messages command scans your Django project for text strings marked for translation in your code and creates or updates message files for
different languages.

instances of the {% trans %} template tag and generates a message file for each specified language. These files are then used to provide translations of 
the marked strings.
